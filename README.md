# PID_BALL
BALANCING A BALL ON BEAM WITH PID USING ARDUINO AND PLOTTING GRAPH IN MATLAB
I used Arduino as PID controller to balance a small ball. 
An ultrasonic sensor detects the ball's position and calculates the servo motor's angle based on the ball's position using a PID code. 
I plotted the ball's position against time on the graph using Matlab/Simulink.
